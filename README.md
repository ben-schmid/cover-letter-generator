## Cover Letter Generator

This was my first attempt at a Full-Stack app. Utilziing React, Flask, and MongoDB, I learned many skills in full-stack development and applied skills learned to future projects and executed them better, such as componenet design in react.

The app generates a cover letter for the user by taking the user resume, job description and company and sending that info to OpenAI API to generate a cover letter. The cover letters are then saved to mongoDB so the user can access it at a later date.
